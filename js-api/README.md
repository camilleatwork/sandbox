# JavaScript API App

Create a front end app to display API data. Uses the [axois](https://github.com/axios/axios) [library](https://github.com/axios/axios) to make our HTTP call. Pulling data from [TVMaze](https://www.tvmaze.com/api) (specifically the TV show _The Boondocks_). Inspired by [tutorial](https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-connect-to-an-api-with-javascript).
